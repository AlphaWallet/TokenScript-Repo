	<p>What's the problem of today's crypto-tokens?</p>
	<p>They don't do anything.</p>

	<h2>C'mon<br/>Do something ...</h2>

		Various Tokens</p>
	<hr style="clear:both;"/>
	<p>Well, anything besides being bought and sold.

	<p>What's the value of a house if it doesn't shelter people?
	What's the value of a car if it doesn't move?</p>

	<p>What's the value of a token if it doesn't function?</p>

	<p>Clearly we can't speculate forever.</p>
	<h2>What can tokens do?</h2>
	<p>Much.</p>
	<p>Token represents rights.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have the right to an airbnb lodge for a
		month, you should be able to enter the house with your
		token.</li>
		<li>If you have the right of a club member, your
		membership token allows you to vote, to login to the
		club's forum, to enter the club's door.</li>
		<li>If you have a token that represents the right to
			use a global WIFI network, you should be able to connect to its hotspots.</li>
		<li>If you own a cryptokitty, you should be able to
		use it in games.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How to make tokens do things?</h2>

	<p>First, they has to be super easy to use. A user should be able
		to use a token from the wallet or dapp browser.</p>

	<p>Then they should be open, interoperable.
		If your token only works on one website, or one system, you
	don't need a crypto token. A record in a centralised database will
	do.</p>

	<p>Third, it also has to be secure while used, not only secure while bought and sold.</p>

	<p>TokenScript is Designed for such needs. More on this topic can be found in the design paper (look at the navigation bar).</p>
