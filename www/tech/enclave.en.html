<h1>TokenScript Technology - Token enclave</h1>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Today, Dapps based on Ethereum has not achieved <strong>Trust, Interoperability, Privacy and Security</strong>, or TIPS for short.</p>
    <p>We will start with this minimalist dapp idea and explain the problems by an example.</p>
    <p>This is a dapp called <em>Hello Kitty</em>. It displays a user's crypto kitten in a matching background. That's all what it does. For example, this kitty look like it belongs to a garden, so we match it with a patch of green:</p>
    <img src="kitty-1129952.svg" alt="A crypto-kitty sitting in a garden" width="100%"/>
    </p>
    <p>With this example in mind, let's look at TIPS:</p>
    <dl><dt>Trust</dt>
        <dd>Even if the website is secured with SSL, the user can hardly be sure that the kitty being drawn there is his token. An honest website usually offer the picture by linking it from cryptokitty.com or use cryptokitty.com's JavaScript library to draw it, but a normal user wouldn't be able to tell. In fact, the website could have been made entirely in in a static picture. This lack of trust on token data is why DApp users often to go to etherscan.org to verify what he sees.</dd>
        <dt>Interoperability</dt>
        <dd>If cryptoktty token's issuer start to issue new tokens, like this kitty with flies around his head, they have no way to ensure the token is rendered correctly. Kitty In The Garden website could be using an outdated JavaScript library. </dd>
        <dt>Privacy</dt>
        <dd>If the user has more than one kitty, he couldn't have chosen one to be rendered in the garden without the website learning about all his litter.</dd>
        <dt>Security</dt>
        <dd>The user is at risk of losing her kitty, if the website offers to do a transaction with the kitty. For one thing, a user wouldn't be able to match the ID of the kitty in transaction data with the one drawn on the screen. This issue is so serious that MetaMask and a few DApp browsers resorted to hardcode the rendering of cryptokitties.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The lack of TIPS is a problem, but blockchain is not there to be blamed. The underlying blockchain likely already facilitate trust and security, and may have certain level of privacy and interoperability provided by smart contracts. But these are lost as Dapps are individual websites which, upon visiting, can arbitrarily dictate what the user sees or could do, or what code the user has to run.</p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Our answer is a <strong>Token Enclave</strong> where token logic is separated from the application logic and safely executed. </p>
    <ol><li>First, the token issuer can write the code for token. In the cryptokitty case, how a kitty look like. How to safely transfer a kitty to a friend etc etc.</li>
        <li>Then, the Dapp browser can use that verified code to render the kitty in an enclave. The enclave access the blockchain directly.</li></ol>
    <p>In the following example. </p>
