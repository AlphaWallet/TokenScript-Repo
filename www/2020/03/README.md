# TokenScript Readme

### The schema version in this repo is above my version, how can I use an older version?

If you have a TokenScript file which includes an older version of the schema, you can refer to it with a link instead of referencing the file directly. 

Example: `http://tokenscript.org/2019/10/tokenscript` for the May version of the schema.
