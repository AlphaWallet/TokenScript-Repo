  <title>TokenScript June 2020 edition</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>TokenScript 2020 June edition</h1>
  <p>TokenScript is a growing specification. There are two ways the
  schema for the specirication grows.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Adding new elements, new features, deprecating old
    elements.</li>
    <li>Change or obsolete elements, features.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Most changes are in the first category, and we are able to
  update the schema without changing the schema's namespace. The
  TokenScripts written following the earlier versions of the schema
  in the same namespace will still work, and the authors doesn't
  need to change it or resign it.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, typically annually, we will make significant
  changes in the second category, as a result of refactoring
  previus designs. This such as the renaming of elements or shift
  in the order of items. This would lead to a change of namespace.
  Unfortunately at this time the existing TokenScripts need to be
  changed and signed again in order to stay compatiable with
  TokenScript engines and libraries that are only designed to
  support the latest namespace.</p>
  <h2>What changed</h2>
  <p>We roughly group them into "changes introduced after March
  2020" and "changes introduced before "March 2020".</p>
  <p>The Jun 2020 TokenScript namespace is:
  http://tokenscript.org/2020/06/tokenscript</p>
  <p>To migrate, you should replace the relative xmlns in your
  TokenScript, typically on the root element (beginning of the
  file). You also need to check every other changes listed below.</p>
  <h2 id="after-march">Changes made after March 2020</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>all cards are to be called <code>&lt;card&gt;</code>
    instead of separately being called <code>&lt;token&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;action&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;attestation&gt;</code> etc.</li>
    <li>in all cards, all references to ethereum events and calls
    are re√§llocated to the <code>ethereum</code> namespace</li>
    <li>overhaul of inconsistent key/refkey naming (sometimes
    <code>name</code> and sometimes <code>id</code>).</li>
    <li>to support default TokenScripts (inheritance, to an
    extent).</li>
    <li>(to be confirmed) replace <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> with an
    extended version of ASN.X.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes made before March 2020</h2>
  <h3>Incorporating ASNX modules</h3>
  <p>A minimalist ANS.X module is introduced. ASN.X is defined by
  RFC 4912, which allows an ASN.X data module to be defined in XML,
  therefore allowing the definition extensible. We extended the
  ANS.X vocabulary by adding ethereum-only attributes and therefore
  making it useful to describe Ethereum events.</p>
  <p>The original intention of introducing ASN.X is to define
  attestations, modelled after X.509 under a sub-working group of
  TokenScript team. The goal is to create a generic framework for
  signing dataObject (ASN.1 module). Conceptually, Etheruem event
  is considered dataObject that doesn't need to be signed, since
  SmartContract generated them following business logic and
  SmartContracts can't sign a dataObject by design. Hence they are
  defined alike in TokenScript.</p>
  <h3>Sourcing attribute value from Ethereum's event</h3>
  <p>It's now possible to have an <code>&lt;event&gt;</code> as the
  origin of an attribute-type. Three attributes dictate which
  event's dataObject is used: the reference to a contract, to an
  event's dataObject definition, and a filter. A TokenScript engine
  should filter all Ethereum events under that contract which fits
  the definition, using the filter expression. A filter expression
  is borrowed from RFC 2254, which has been used to filter X.509
  objects as well as other LDAP data objects.</p>
  <h3>Renamed elements</h3>
  <p>All <code>&lt;token-card&gt;</code> elements are renamed to
  <code>&lt;token&gt;</code> element.</p>
  <p>All <code>&lt;iconified-view&gt;</code> elements are renamed
  to <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code> element.</p>
  <p>To migrate, you can do a search-and-replace of the element
  names.</p>
  <h3>Changed hierarchy</h3>
  <p>Previously, <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> is the container of a
  HTML block, so is <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code>.
  <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
  elements are on the same level of <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>Now, both <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code> encloses 3 elements:
  <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. The 3 elements are to be uesed in the
  same fashion as they would be used in HTML documents.</p>
  <p>To migrate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Add XHTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element under
      <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code>,
      enclosing everything that was there.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Copy XHTML <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements under each
      <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>, before <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
      element.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Remove XHTML <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements on the same level of
      <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code>
      element.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Changed recommendation of setting XHTML namespace
  default</h3>
  <p>Previously, many of our examples included XHTML namespace as
  the default namespace for the entire document:</p>
  <pre>&lt;ts:token xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"...</pre>
  <p>so that the XHTML elements used in a TokenScript doesn't have
  to have a namespace prefix, making it easier to work with
  existing HTML editors.</p>
  <p>Now, defining a default namespace breaks ASN.X (RFC 4912).
  Hence we recommend defining such a namespace on the
  <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code>
  elements instead. This achieves the same effect that XHTML
  elements don't have to be written with namespace prefix, yet it
  allows insertion of dataObject definition in the future.</p>
  <p>To migrate, move this attribute from the root element</p>
  <pre> xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</pre>
  <p>to every occurrence of <code>&lt;view&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;item-view&gt;</code> element.</p>
